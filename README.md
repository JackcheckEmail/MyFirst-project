# Json+Table
Parses the Json array and shows it in the table.
The project is only in the initial stage.
It does not process an array within an array that uses [], yet. But in this format everything is fine: {{},{}},{}.For example it can open the BigList.json.
Try others and give me feedback, I will appreciate it.
